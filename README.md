# docker_sentitment_analysis

In this example, a CI/CD pipeline was created to automatically test an API before deployment. The API is based on a sentiment analysis algorithm, packaged in a Docker image, which predicts whether an English sentence has a positive or negative sentiment.

API Endpoints

/status: Simply checks if the API is running.
/permissions: Allows a user, identified by a username and password, to check which model version they have access to.
/Sentiment Analysis Endpoints: These require a sentence as input, verify the user's identity, check their access rights, and return a sentiment score. A score of -1 indicates negative sentiment, while +1 indicates positive sentiment.

Authentication and Authorization Tests

Authentication Test: GET requests is sent to /permissions using two pre-registered users: alice:wonderland and bob:builder. To simulate an unregistered user behavior a third test with clementine:mandarine was sent.
Authorization Test: It ensures that bob has access to version v1 only, while Alice can access both versions. The sentences "life is beautiful" and "that sucks" will be used to test the APIâ€™s sentiment prediction capability.

Each test will be executed in separate containers and will generate a log file describing the results of each test.
